	- ## CDN
		- CDN's are transparent backbones of the internet in charge of content delivery. It is primarily used to deliver static content.
			- CDN stores the cached content in multiple geographical locations called as point of presence or edge servers.
			- ### Advantages of CDN

				- Localize coverage without the cost
				- reduce bandwidth  consumption
				- balance between multiple servers
				- protect your websites from DDOS attacks

			- ### CloudFront (AWS CDN service)
				- Fast broad network of edge locations and cloud-front caches copies of content close to the end users help reduce latency
				- can be used with other AWS services.
				- it is cost effective.
				- located in multiple regions
				- reliable
				- elastic
				- #### How it works?
					- user accesses website and requests to download a image
					- DNS routes the request to the nearest cloudfront edge location
					- At the edge location, cloudfront checks its cache for the file and returns the file.
						- Cloudfront compares the request with the specifications and forwards to the applicable origin server
						- origin server sends the file back to edge server
						- as soon as the first bit arrives from the origin server the server starts forwarding the file to the user. and also add the file to the cache
					- The file will be now stored in the cache server for 24 hours or the set time in the file header
