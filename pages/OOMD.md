		-
		- deals with genesis of application
		- purpose is to  <ins>defer details </ins> and <ins>understand the big picture</ins>
		- ### Steps for system conception
			- ##### 1: Devising a System Concept
				- Some ways of devising new System Concepts
					- <ins>New Functionality:</ins> add functionality to existing system
					- <ins>Streamlining:</ins> remove restrictions or generalize the way  a system works.
					- <ins>Simplification</ins> allow ordinary persons to perform tasks
					- <ins>Automation:</ins> Automate manual processes
					- <ins>Integration:</ins> combine functionality from different systems
					- <ins>Analogies:</ins>check other problems in other domains for useful ideas
					- <ins>Globalization:</ins> travel to observe business and cultural practices.
			- ##### 2: Elaborating a concept
				- who is the application for?
				- clear understanding of stake holders
				- problems solved
				- why it is needed
				- what will it be used for
				- how will it work
			- ##### 3: Preparing a Problem Statement
				- Requirements and design decisions should not be
				  mixed.
				- The system is considered as a black box
				- Design decision are engineering choice that provides
				  the behavior specified by requirements.
				- The problem statement should state what is to be
				  done but not how it is to be implemented.
				- It should be statements of needs, not a proposal for
				  system architecture.
				- The requestor should avoid describing system internal,
				  as this restricts development flexibility.
				- The problem statement is just a starting point for
				  understanding the problem, not a immutable
				  document

	- ## Object Oriented Analysis
		- Basic Principles
			- The Information Domain is modeled
			- Behavior is represented
			- Function is described
			- Data, Functional, and Behavioral models are divided to uncover greater detail
			- Early models represent the essence of the problem, while later ones provide implementation details
